## About
Moi is a single-page personal site template, created to reduce the trouble of designing, developing and maintaining your own personal site while keeping it light, customizable and simple. It is free and opensource, so you still have the freedom to add your own changes and features. Moi uses a single json file to fetch data and render it, which makes it extremely simple to make changes.
